  abstract         = {Business Model Generation is a handbook for visionaries, game changers, and challengers striving to defy outmoded business models and design tomorrow's enterprises. If your organization needs to adapt to harsh new realities, but you don't yet have a strategy that will get you out in front of your competitors, you need Business Model Generation. Co-created by 470 "Business Model Canvas" practitioners from 45 countries, the book features a beautiful, highly visual, 4-color design that takes powerful strategic ideas and tools, and makes them easy to implement in your organization. It explains the most common Business Model patterns, based on concepts from leading business thinkers, and helps you reinterpret them for your own context. You will learn how to systematically understand, design, and implement a game-changing business model--or analyze and renovate an old one. Along the way, you'll understand at a much deeper level your customers, distribution channels, partners, revenue streams, costs, and your core value proposition. Business Model Generation features practical innovation techniques used today by leading consultants and companies worldwide, including 3M, Ericsson, Capgemini, Deloitte, and others. Designed for doers, it is for those ready to abandon outmoded thinking and embrace new models of value creation: for executives, consultants, entrepreneurs, and leaders of all organizations. If you're ready to change the rules, you belong to "the business model generation!"},

  abstract         = {Considerando o rápido crescimento que a área de projeto e desenvolvimento de jogos digitais vive, as tarefas de gamificação e de game design thinking são comumente confundidas, embora ambas tenham propostas e aplicações bem especificas. A gamificação relaciona-se ao pensamento orientado a jogo (game
thinking), em processos que não são jogos, visando atingir um objetivo e empregando, para tanto, mecanismos de engajamento com incremento da motivação. Já o game design thinking trata de uma metodologia voltada ao projeto e ao desenvolvimento de jogos com base em conceitos extraídos e/ou adaptados do design thinking
e que podem agregar, de forma significativa, ao processo de projeto e desenvolvimento de um jogo. No entanto, nota-se que, de um modo geral, a área de desenvolvimento de jogos digitais carece de metodologias comprovadas, que auxiliem o estudante e o profissional da área a pensar no processo de design do jogo no
sentido projetual. Este trabalho propõe uma metodologia voltada ao projeto e ao desenvolvimento de jogos digitais baseada em design thinking e em conceitos ágeis e enxutos, a partir das experiências dos autores como professores de disciplinas de cursos de graduação e pós-graduação. A metodologia é discutida a partir de estudos de caso com apontamentos de resultados obtidos, os quais indicam a produção de resultados mais criativos, inovadores e robustos.},

  abstract         = {Many seemingly different problems in artificial intelligence, symbolic processing, and machine learning can be viewed as requiring discovery of a computer program that produces some desired output for particular inputs. When viewed in this way, the process of solving these problems becomes equivalent to searching a space of possible computer programs for a most fit individual computer program. The new "genetic programming" paradigm described herein provides a way to search for this most fit individual computer program. In this new "genetic programming" paradigm, populations of computer programs are genetically bred using the Darwinian principle of survival of the fittest and using a genetic crossover (recombination) operator appropriate for genetically mating computer programs. In this paper, the process of formulating and solving problems using this new paradigm is illustrated using examples from various areas. Examples come from the areas of machine learning of a function; planning; sequence induction; function function identification (including symbolic regression, empirical discovery, "data to function" symbolic integration, "data to function" symbolic differentiation); solving equations, including differential equations, integral equations, and functional equations); concept formation; automatic programming; pattern recognition, time-optimal control; playing differential pursuer-evader games; neural network design; and finding a game-playing strategyfor a discrete game in extensive form.},

However, these tools focus mostly on high-level aspects and requirements and do not help understand how such high-level requirements can be concretely satisfied. In this paper, we present a conceptual model, called Activity Theory-based Model of Serious Games (ATMSG), that aims to fill this gap. ATMSG supports a systematic and detailed representation of educational serious games, depicting the ways that game elements are connected to each other throughout the game, and how these elements contribute to the achievement of the desired pedagogical goals. Three evaluation studies indicate that ATMSG helped participants, particularly those with gaming experience, identify and understand the roles of each component in the game and recognize the game's educational objectives.},

2006 Abstract:
After years of research and proselytizing, the proponents of digital game-based learning (DGBL) have been caught unaware. Like the person who is still yelling after the sudden cessation of loud music at a party, DGBL proponents have been shouting to be heard above the prejudice against games. But now, unexpectedly, we have everyone’s attention. The combined weight of three factors has resulted in widespread public interest in games as learning tools.

2015 Abstract:
Nearly a decade ago, I wrote an article for EDUCAUSE Review about digital game-based learning (DGBL) and the challenges it faced.1 I suggested that once proponents of DGBL were successful in convincing people that games could play a role in education, they would be unprepared to provide practical guidance for implementing DGBL. Just as when the person shouting to be heard at a party is suddenly the center of attention at the moment there is a lull in the conversation, we DGBL proponents had everyone's attention—but not much to say. In the article I also suggested that our sometimes overzealous defense of videogames (hereafter often referred to as "digital games") ran the risk of overselling the benefits (and underreporting the challenges) of using digital games in formal education.

Digital games, I said then and still believe today, are effective as embodiments of effective learning theories that can promote higher-order outcomes. Our inability to provide guidance in doing so a decade ago was ceding the DGBL front to digital games as tools for making didactic, instructivist learning (i.e., lectures) more "engaging." DGBL, I suggested, was effective not as a means for making learning "fun" or for "tricking" students into learning; DGBL was effective because it supported powerful learning strategies such as situated learning, authentic environments, and optimized challenge and support (scaffolding). What was needed was a renewed focus on (1) research about why DGBL is effective and (2) guidance on how, when, for whom, and under what conditions to integrate digital games into formal education.

I was not the only one with these ideas, but my timing and the venue combined to reach many people. That 2006 article has been cited more than 1,000 times since then.2 Yet though these ideas continue to resonate with many people, much has changed in terms of research, practice, and to some extent, my own beliefs about the future of DGBL.},

  abstract         = {Although there is a consensus on the instructional potential of Serious Games (SGs), there is still a lack of methodologies and tools not only for design but also to support analysis and assessment. Filling this gap is one of the main aims of the Games and Learning Alliance (http://www.galanoe.eu) European Network of Excellence on Serious Games, which has a focus upon pedagogy-driven SGs. This paper relies on the assumption that the fundamental aspect of SG design consists in the translation of learning goals/practices into mechanical element of gameplay, serving to an instructional purpose beside that of play and fun. This paper proposes the Learning Mechanics–Game Mechanics (LM-GM) model, which supports SG analysis and design by allowing reflection on the various pedagogical and game elements in an SG. The LM-GM model includes a set of pre-defined game mechanics and pedagogical elements that we have abstracted from literature on game studies and learning theories. Designers and analysts can exploit these mechanics to draw the LM-GM map for a game, so as to identify and highlight its main pedagogical and entertainment features, and their interrelations. The tool may also be useful for teachers to evaluate the effectiveness of a given game and better understand how to implement it in educational settings. A case study is reported to illustrate the framework's support in determining how gameplay and pedagogy intertwine in an SG. Finally, the paper presents the results of two comparative user tests demonstrating the advantages of the proposed model with respect to a similar state-of-the-art framework.},

Due to the elements of surprise and simulation, these games potentially engage and inspire their target groups more than traditional methods. Health games are SGs that provide a new model of maintaining and developing mental and physical capabilities for all age groups. The current study focused on the use of SGs in health care. The research goal was to identify the role of multidisciplinary expertise in developing SGs. Design science research (DSR) techniques were adopted in this study to identify the role of versatile expertise in the health-care context. From the perspective of DSR, this study provides new tools and a method-a rapid prototyping workshop and an SG design canvas-that can help in providing the needed knowledge and in developing ways to communicate these ideas. In this study, the developed tools and method were applied to six case studies, and lessons learnt were evaluated and tested by participants in the workshop. The proposed SG design canvas also supports a participatory design process and invites users to contribute early in the development process. Overall, this study shows that good health game development can only occur through effective multidisciplinary cooperation.},

The comparison of the original and revised taxonomy indicates several modifications such as the change in the level names, the arrangement of the levels and the number of dimensions. The cognitive domain of the original and revised Bloom’s Taxonomy has currently been applied in the design of online instructional games. The paper examines how the Bloom’s Taxonomy has been applied in various instructional games and propose how it can be applied in the development of instructional games for learning grammar. Recent studies reveal the Bloom’s Taxonomy has been applied in the instructional game development by designing instructional games based on learning objectives and learning outcomes that were previously written using the Bloom’s Taxonomy, and as the basis in creating the game levels. It is evident that the application of the Bloom’s Taxonomy in the instructional game design fulfill the educational features of instructional games. Therefore, it is significantly important to propose on how the Bloom’s Taxonomy need to be applied in the development of instructional games especially for learning grammar in order to ensure efficient game development for effective learning.},

configuração. A partir da ferramenta de concepção de jogos "Game Design Canvas" e com 
auxílio de Metodologias de Design, a apresentação de um novo Canvas é o objeto de estudo 
deste trabalho, com o intuito de auxiliar a concepção não apenas de jogos, mas a definição de 
sua cadeia de valor. Para tanto, são explorados os conceitos de: modelos de negócios, 
Metodologias de Design, jogos e um retrospecto sobre a evolução das estratégias de 
comercialização de jogos. Finalmente, para demonstrar a aplicação da extensão do Design 
Thinking Canvas, um exemplo prático do jogo Bubble Witch Saga 2 é apresentado. Como

To address this issue, we obtained real chat data from MovieStarPlanet, a massively multiplayer online game for children. The research described in this paper aimed to detect predatory behaviors in the chats using machine learning methods. In order to achieve a high accuracy on this task, extensive preprocessing was necessary. We describe three different strategies for data selection and preprocessing, and extensively compare the performance of different learning algorithms on the different data sets and features.},

"Big ideas" such as justice, equity, honesty, and cooperation -- as well as other kinds of ideas, including violence, exploitation, and greed -- may emerge in games whether designers intend them or not. In this book, Mary Flanagan and Helen Nissenbaum present Values at Play, a theoretical and practical framework for identifying socially recognized moral and political values in digital games. Values at Play can also serve as a guide to designers who seek to implement values in the conception and design of their games. After developing a theoretical foundation for their proposal, Flanagan and Nissenbaum provide detailed examinations of selected games, demonstrating the many ways in which values are embedded in them. They introduce the Values at Play heuristic, a systematic approach for incorporating values into the game design process. Interspersed among the book's chapters are texts by designers who have put Values at Play into practice by accepting values as a design constraint like any other, offering a real-world perspective on the design challenges involved.},

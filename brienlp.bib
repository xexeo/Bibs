  abstract         = {In information retrieval, it is common to model index terms and documents as vectors in a suitably defined vector space. The main difficulty with this approach is that the explicit representation of term vectors is not known a priori. For this reason, the vector space model adopted by Salton for the SMART system treats the terms as a set of orthogonal vectors. In such a model it is often necessary to adopt a separate, corrective procedure to take into account the correlations between terms. In this paper, we propose a systematic method (the generalized vector space model) to compute term correlations directly from automatic indexing scheme. We also demonstrate how such correlations can be included with minimal modification in the existing vector based information retrieval systems. The preliminary experimental results obtained from the new model are very encouraging.},

  abstract         = {In a new method for automatic indexing and retrieval, implicit higher-order structure in the association of terms with documents is modeled to improve estimates of term-document association, and therefore the detection of relevant documents on the basis of terms found in queries. Singular-value decomposition is used to decompose a large term by document matrix into 50 to 150 orthogonal factors from which the original matrix can be approximated by linear combination; both documents and terms are represented as vectors in a 50- to 150- dimensional space. Queries are represented as pseudo-documents vectors formed from weighted combinations of terms, and documents are ordered by their similarity to the query. Initial tests find this automatic method very promising.},

  abstract         = {Research in IT must address the design tasks faced by practitioners. Real problems must be properly conceptualized and represented, appropriate techniques for their solution must be constructed, and solutions must be implemented and evaluated using appropriate criteria. If significant progress is to be made, IT research must also develop an understanding of how and why IT systems work or do not work. Such an understanding must tie together natural laws governing IT systems with natural laws governing the environments in which they operate. This paper presents a two dimensional framework for research in information technology. The first dimension is based on broad types of design and natural science research activities: build, evaluate, theorize, and justify. The second dimension is based on broad types of outputs produced by design research: representational constructs, models, methods, and instantiations. We argue that both design science and natural science activities are needed to insure that IT research is both relevant and effective.},

We develop a set of algorithmic tools for extracting information from the link structures of such environments, and report on experiments that demonstrate their effectiveness in a variety of context on the World Wide Web. The central issue we address within our framework is the distillation of broad search topics, through the discovery of “authorative” information sources on such topics. We propose and test an algorithmic formulation of the notion of authority, based on the relationship between a set of relevant authoritative pages and the set of “hub pages” that join them together in the link structure. Our formulation has connections to the eigenvectors of certain matrices associated with the link graph; these connections in turn motivate additional heuristrics for link-based analysis.},

It has long been recognized that the primary obstacle to effective performance of classical models is the need to estimate arelevance model: probabilities of words in the relevant class. We propose a novel technique for estimating these probabilities using the query alone. We demonstrate that our technique can produce highly accurate relevance models, addressing important notions of synonymy and polysemy. Our experiments show relevance models outperforming baseline language modeling systems on TREC retrieval and TDT tracking tasks. The main contribution of this work is an effective formal method for estimating a relevance model with no training data.},

  abstract         = {Today, when searching for information on the WWW, one usually performs a query through a term-based search engine. These engines return, as the query's result, a list of Web pages whose contents matches the query. For broad-topic queries, such searches often result in a huge set of retrieved documents, many of which are irrelevant to the user. However, much information is contained in the link-structure of the WWW. Information such as which pages are linked to others can be used to augment search algorithms. In this context, Jon Kleinberg introduced the notion of two distinct types of Web pages: hubs and authorities. Kleinberg argued that hubs and authorities exhibit a mutually reinforcing relationship: a good hub will point to many authorities, and a good authority will be pointed at by many hubs. In light of this, he dervised an algoirthm aimed at finding authoritative pages. We present SALSA, a new stochastic approach for link-structure analysis, which examines random walks on graphs derived from the link-structure. We show that both SALSA and Kleinberg's Mutual Reinforcement approach employ the same metaalgorithm. We then prove that SALSA is quivalent to a weighted in degree analysis of the link-sturcutre of WWW subgraphs, making it computationally more efficient than the Mutual reinforcement approach. We compare that results of applying SALSA to the results derived through Kleinberg's approach. These comparisions reveal a topological Phenomenon called the TKC effectwhich, in certain cases, prevents the Mutual reinforcement approach from identifying meaningful authorities.},

  abstract         = {This essay develops the philosophical foundations for design research in the Technology of Information Systems (TIS). Traditional writings on philosophy of science cannot fully describe this mode of research, which dares to intervene and improve to realize alternative futures instead of explaining or interpreting the past to discover truth. Accordingly, in addition to philosophy of science, the essay draws on writings about the act of designing, philosophy of technology and the substantive (IS) discipline. I define design research in TIS as in(ter)vention in the representational world defined by the hierarchy of concerns following semiotics. The complementary nature of the representational (internal) and real (external) environments provides the basis to articulate the dual ontological and epistemological bases. Understanding design research in TIS in this manner suggests operational principles in the internal world as the form of knowledge created by design researchers, and artifacts that embody these are seen as situated instantiations of normative theories that affect the external phenomena of interest. Throughout the paper, multiple examples illustrate the arguments. Finally, I position the resulting ‘method’ for design research vis-à-vis existing research methods and argue for its legitimacy as a viable candidate for research in the IS discipline.},

The methodological basis for this work is design science, where the researcher builds an artifact to solve a specific problem. In this case the aim is to provide an ontology that makes it possible to explicit a firm's business model. In other words, the proposed artifact helps a firm to formally describe its value proposition, its customers, the relationship with them, the necessary intra- and inter-firm infrastructure and its profit model. Such an ontology is relevant because until now there is no model that expresses a company's global business logic from a pure business point of view. Previous models essentially take an organizational or process perspective or cover only parts of a firm's business logic. The four main pillars of the ontology, which are inspired by management science and enterprise- and processmodeling, are product, customer interface, infrastructure and finance. The ontology is validated by case studies, a panel of experts and managers. The dissertation also provides a software prototype to capture a company's business model in an information system. The last part of the thesis consists of a demonstration of the value of the ontology in business strategy and Information Systems (IS) alignment.},

Both paradigms are foundational to the IS discipline, positioned as it is at the confluence of people, organizations, and technology. Our objective is to describe the performance of design-science research in Information Systems via a concise conceptual framework and clear guidelines for understanding, executing, and evaluating the research. In the design-science paradigm, knowledge and understanding of a problem domain and its solution are achieved in the building and application of the designed artifact. Three recent exemplars in the research literature are used to demonstrate the application of these guidelines.

Many models for understanding LSI have been proposed. Ours is the first to study the values produced by LSI in the term by dimension vectors. The framework presented here is based on term co-occurrence data. We show a strong correlation between second-order term co-occurrence and the values produced by the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) algorithm that forms the foundation for LSI. We also present a mathematical proof that the SVD algorithm encapsulates term co-occurrence information.},

  abstract         = {This paper proposes a new method for computing page importance, referred to as BrowseRank. The conventional approach to compute page importance is to exploit the link graph of the web and to build a model based on that graph. For instance, PageRank is such an algorithm, which employs a discrete-time Markov process as the model. Unfortunately, the link graph might be incomplete and inaccurate with respect to data for determining page importance, because links can be easily added and deleted by web content creators. In this paper, we propose computing page importance by using a 'user browsing graph' created from user behavior data. In this graph, vertices represent pages and directed edges represent transitions between pages in the users' web browsing history. Furthermore, the lengths of staying time spent on the pages by users are also included. The user browsing graph is more reliable than the link graph for inferring page importance. This paper further proposes using the continuous-time Markov process on the user browsing graph as a model and computing the stationary probability distribution of the process as page importance. An efficient algorithm for this computation has also been devised. In this way, we can leverage hundreds of millions of users' implicit voting on page importance. Experimental results show that BrowseRank indeed outperforms the baseline methods such as PageRank and TrustRank in several tasks.},

Soft Design Science provides an approach to the development of new ways to improve human organizations, especially with consideration for social aspects, through the activities of design, development, instantiation, evaluation and evolution of a technological artifact. The Soft Design Science approach merges the common design science research process (design, build-artifact, evaluation) together with the iterative soft systems methodology. The design-build artifact-evaluation process is iterated until the specific requirements are met. The generalized requirements are adjusted as the process continues to keep alignment with the specific requirements. In the end, the artifact represents a general solution to a class of problems shown to operate in one instance of that class of problems. The proposed methodology is evaluated by an analysis of how it differs from, and could have informed and improved, a published design science study, which used a design-oriented action research method.},

  abstract         = {Detection of child exploitation in Internet chatting is an important issue for the protection of children from prospective online paedophiles. This paper investigates the effectiveness of text classifiers to identify Child Exploitation (CE) in chatting. As the chatting occurs among two or more users by typing texts, the text of chat-messages can be used as the data to be analysed by text classifiers. Therefore the problem of identification of CE chats can be framed as the problem of text classification by categorizing the chatlogs into predefined CE types. Along with three traditional text categorizing techniques a new approach has been made to accomplish the task. Psychometric and categorical information by LIWC (Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count) has been used and improvement of performance in some classifier has been found. For the experiments of current research the chat logs are collected from various websites open to public. Classification-viaRegression, J-48-Decision-Tree and NaïveBayes classifiers are used. Comparison of the performance of the classifiers is shown in the result.},

In order to do so, we use the sexual terms of the dictionary as a query in an information retrieval system, thus, retrieving the documents that best match with the query introduced. The second approach uses the multinomial Naïve Bayes classifier in order to detect sexual predators. The first approach performed better than the second one with low percentages of precision and high values of recall.},

In the first two, authors try to convince others that the presented work is theirs, and in the third there is an attempt to convince readers to take actions based on false beliefs or ill-perceived risks. In this paper, we discuss our approaches to these tasks in the Author Identification track at PAN2012, which represents our first proper attempt at any of them. Our initial intention was to determine whether cues of deception, documented in the literature, might be relevant to such tasks. However, it quickly became apparent that such cues would not be readily useful, and we discuss the results achieved using some simple but relatively novel approaches: for the Traditional Authorship Attribution task, we show how a mean-variance framework using just 10 stopwords detects 42.8\% and could be obtain 52.12\% using fewer; for Intrinsic Plagiarism Detection, frequent words achieved 91.1\% overall; and for Sexual Predator Identification, we used just a few features covering requests for personal information, with
mixed results.},

We developed three machine learning approaches for these tasks. For the two authorship related tasks we created various sets of feature spaces, where individual differences in writing styles are assumed to surface in just a subset of these spaces. The challenge there was to combine these feature spaces to enable the machine learning algorithms to detect these differences across multiple feature spaces. In the case of authorship attribution we combined the results of multiple base classifiers by following a supervised vote/veto meta classifier approach. For the intrinsic plagiarism/authorship clustering subtask we used an unsupervised ensemble clustering approach in order to combine information from several feature spaces. In the sexual predator identification task we applied a supervised sequence classification approach to uncover temporal patterns within chat conversations by categorizing not only the offending messages, but also the reactions to these offending messages.},

We contend that DSR has yet to attain its full potential impact on the development and use of information systems due to gaps in the understanding and application of DSR concepts and methods. This essay aims to help researchers (1) appreciate the levels of artifact abstractions that may be DSR contributions, (2) identify appropriate ways of consuming and producing knowledge when they are preparing journal articles or other scholarly works, (3) understand and position the knowledge contributions of their research projects, and (4) structure a DSR article so that it emphasizes significant contributions to the knowledge base. Our focal contribution is the DSR knowledge contribution framework with two dimensions based on the existing state of knowledge in both the problem and solution domains for the research opportunity under study. In addition, we propose a DSR communication schema with similarities to more conventional publication patterns, but which substitutes the description of the DSR artifact in place of a traditional results section. We evaluate the DSR contribution framework and the DSR communication schema via examinations of DSR exemplar publications.},

It provides comprehensive guidance on how to conduct such research and supplies in-depth treatment of design science theory and the different types of theory that can be generated in design science research.Making novel use of the concept of patterns, it presents 84 research patterns for conducting effective DSR. It emphasizes design science theory throughout and is filled with practical examples of using patterns to conduct information and communication technology research (ICT).With a focus on reusing research activities to increase the effectiveness and efficiency of conducting design science research, the book relies on familiar patterns to provide the fundamentals of various research philosophies and techniques required to innovate ICT. It describes design science research in relation to other information systems research paradigms such as positivist and interpretivist research. New to this edition are relevant design science research patterns adapted from TRIZ, the widely regarded European engineering design and creativity method.This edition also provides greatly expanded treatment of theory building in design science research (DSR), a topic of rapidly growing interest in addition to a new chapter presenting a framework for theory development in DSR.

  abstract         = {Software toolkits play an essential role in information retrieval research. Most open-source toolkits developed by academics are designed to facilitate the evaluation of retrieval models over standard test collections. Efforts are generally directed toward better ranking and less attention is usually given to scalability and other operational considerations. On the other hand, Lucene has become the de facto platform in industry for building search applications (outside a small number of companies that deploy custom infrastructure). Compared to academic IR toolkits, Lucene can handle heterogeneous web collections at scale, but lacks systematic support for evaluation over standard test collections. This paper introduces Anserini, a new information retrieval toolkit that aims to provide the best of both worlds, to better align information retrieval practice and research. Anserini provides wrappers and extensions on top of core Lucene libraries that allow researchers to use more intuitive APIs to accomplish common research tasks. Our initial efforts have focused on three functionalities: scalable, multi-threaded inverted indexing to handle modern web-scale collections, streamlined IR evaluation for ad hoc retrieval on standard test collections, and an extensible architecture for multi-stage ranking. Anserini ships with support for many TREC test collections, providing a convenient way to replicate competitive baselines right out of the box. Experiments verify that our system is both efficient and effective, providing a solid foundation to support future research.},

The event featured three main elements: (i) a series of keynote and invited talks on industry, teaching and evaluation; (ii) planning, coding and hacking where a number of groups created modules and infrastructure to use Lucene to undertake TREC based evaluations; and (iii) a number of breakout groups discussing challenges, opportunities and problems in bridging the divide between academia and industry, and how we can use Lucene for teaching and learning Information Retrieval (IR). The event was composed of a mix and blend of academics, experts and students wanting to learn, share and create evaluation resources for the community. The hacking was intense and the discussions lively creating the basis of many useful tools but also raising numerous issues. It was clear that by adopting and contributing to most widely used and supported Open Source IR toolkit, there were many benefits for academics, students, researchers, developers and practitioners - providing a basis for stronger evaluation practices, increased reproducibility, more efficient knowledge transfer, greater collaboration between academia and industry, and shared teaching and training resources.},

  abstract         = {E-communication represents a major threat to users who are exposed to a number of risks and potential attacks. Detecting these risks with as much anticipation as possible is crucial for prevention. However, much research so far has focused on forensic tools that can be applied only when an attack has been performed. This paper proposes a novel and effective methodology for the early detection of threats in written social media. The goal is to recognize a potential attack before it is consummated, and using a minimum amount of information. The proposed approach considers the use of profile-based representations (PBRs) for this goal. PBRs have multiple benefits, including non-sparsity, low dimensionality, and a proved discriminative power. Moreover, representations for partial documents can be derived naturally with PBRs, which makes them suitable for the addressed problem. Results include empirical evidence on the usefulness of PBRs in the early recognition setting for two tasks in which anticipation is critical: sexual predator detection and aggressive text identification. These results reveal, on the one hand, that PBRs achieve state of the art performance when using full-length documents (i.e., the classical task), and, on the other hand, that the proposed methodology outperforms previous work on early recognition of sexual predators by a considerable margin, while obtaining state of the art performance in aggressive text identification. To the best of our knowledge, these are the best results reported on early recognition for the approached problems. We foresee this work will pave the way for the development of novel methodologies for the problem and will motivate further research from the intelligent systems and text mining communities.},

Although academic information retrieval researchers have a long history of building and sharing systems, they are primarily designed to facilitate the publication of research papers. As such, these systems are often incomplete, inflexible, poorly documented, difficult to use, and slow, particularly in the context of modern web-scale collections. Furthermore, the growing complexity of modern software ecosystems and the resource constraints most academic research groups operate under make maintaining open-source systems a constant struggle. However, except for a small number of companies (mostly commercial web search engines) that deploy custom infrastructure, Lucene has become the de facto platform in industry for building search applications. Lucene has an active developer base, a large audience of users, and diverse capabilities to work with heterogeneous collections at scale. However, it lacks systematic support for ad hoc experimentation using standard test collections. We describe Anserini, an information retrieval toolkit built on Lucene that fills this gap. Our goal is to simplify ad hoc experimentation and allow researchers to easily reproduce results with modern bag-of-words ranking models on diverse test collections. With Anserini, we demonstrate that Lucene provides a suitable framework for supporting information retrieval research. Experiments show that our system efficiently indexes large web collections, provides modern ranking models that are on par with research implementations in terms of effectiveness, and supports low-latency query evaluation to facilitate rapid experimentation},

  abstract         = {Pyserini is a Python toolkit for reproducible information retrieval research with sparse and dense representations. It aims to provide effective, reproducible, and easy-to-use first-stage retrieval in a multi-stage ranking architecture. Our toolkit is self-contained as a standard Python package and comes with queries, relevance judgments, pre-built indexes, and evaluation scripts for many commonly used IR test collections. We aim to support, out of the box, the entire research lifecycle of efforts aimed at improving ranking with modern neural approaches. In particular, Pyserini supports sparse retrieval (e.g., BM25 scoring using bag-of-words representations), dense retrieval (e.g., nearest-neighbor search on transformer-encoded representations), as well as hybrid retrieval that integrates both approaches. This paper provides an overview of toolkit features and presents empirical results that illustrate its effectiveness on two popular ranking tasks. Around this toolkit, our group has built a culture of reproducibility through shared norms and tools that enable rigorous automated testing.},

By also encoding the language used by an author’s partners and some small heuristics, we boost performance to an F1 score of 0.83. We identify the most “predatory” messages by calculating a score for each message equal to the average of the weights of the n-grams therein, as determined by a linear SVM model. We boost performance with a manually constructed “blacklist”.},

The proposed approach divides documents into three parts, which, we hypothesize, correspond to the different stages that a predator employs when approaching a child. Local classifiers are trained for each part of the documents and their outputs are combined by a chain strategy: predictions of a local classifier are used as extra inputs for the next local classifier.Additionally, we propose a ring-based strategy, in which the chaining process is iterated several times, with the goal of further improving the performance of our method. We report experimental results on the corpus used in the first international competition on sexual predator identification (PAN’12). Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms a standard (global) classification technique for the different settings we consider; besides the proposed method compares favorably with most methods evaluated in the PAN’12 competition.},

The classification results show that the NPS data and the pedophiles’ conversations can be accurately discriminated from each other with character n-grams, while in the more complicated case of cybersex logs there is need for high-level features to reach good accuracy levels. In this latter setting our results show that features that model behaviour and emotion significantly outperform the low-level ones, and achieve a 97\% accuracy.},

  abstract         = {This paper presents a system developed for detecting sexual predators in online chat conversations using a two-stage classification and behavioral features. A sexual predator is defined as a person who tries to obtain sexual favors in a predatory manner, usually with underage people. The proposed approach uses several text categorization methods and empirical behavioral features developed especially for the task at hand. After investigating various approaches for solving the sexual predator identification problem, we have found that a two-stage classifier achieves the best results. In the first stage, we employ a Support Vector Machine classifier to distinguish conversations having suspicious content from safe online discussions. This is useful as most chat conversations in real life do not contain a sexual predator, therefore it can be viewed as a filtering phase that enables the actual detection of predators to be done only for suspicious chats that contain a sexual predator with a very high degree. In the second stage, we detect which of the users in a suspicious discussion is an actual predator using a Random Forest classifier. The system was tested on the corpus provided by the PAN 2012 workshop organizers and the results are encouraging because, as far as we know, our solution outperforms all previous approaches developed for solving this task.},

In this work, we present an authorship attribution model that trains on a corpus of online conversations involving predators, and perform subsequent analysis of the message representations. Our results show comparable performance relative to prior work for Authorship Attribution and highlight differences between predatory and non-predatory message styles.},

  abstract         = {The sexual exploitation of minors is a known and persistent problem for law enforcement. Assistance in prioritizing cases of sexual exploitation of potentially risky conversations is crucial. While attempts to automatically triage conversations for the risk of sexual exploitation of minors have been attempted in the past, most computational models use features which are not representative of the grooming process that is used by investigators. Accurately annotating an offender corpus for use with machine learning algorithms is difficult because the stages of the grooming process feed into one another and are non-linear. In this paper we propose a method for labeling risk, tied to stages and themes of the grooming process, using fuzzy sets. We develop a neural network model that uses these fuzzy membership functions of each line in a chat as input and predict the risk of interaction.},

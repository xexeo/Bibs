  abstract         = {A goal of statistical language modeling is to learn the joint probability function of sequences of words in a language. This is intrinsically difficult because of the curse of dimensionality: a word sequence on which the model will be tested is likely to be different from all the word sequences seen during training. Traditional but very successful approaches based on n-grams obtain generalization by concatenating very short overlapping sequences seen in the training set. We propose to fight the curse of dimensionality by learning a distributed representation for words which allows each training sentence to inform the model about an exponential number of semantically neighboring sentences. The model learns simultaneously (1) a distributed representation for each word along with (2) the probability function for word sequences, expressed in terms of these representations. Generalization is obtained because a sequence of words that has never been seen before gets high probability if it is made of words that are similar (in the sense of having a nearby representation) to words forming an already seen sentence. Training such large models (with millions of parameters) within a reasonable time is itself a significant challenge. We report on experiments using neural networks for the probability function, showing on two text corpora that the proposed approach significantly improves on state-of-the-art n-gram models, and that the proposed approach allows to take advantage of longer contexts.},

  abstract         = {Web spam pages use various techniques to achieve higher-than-deserved rankings in a search engine's results. While human experts can identify spam, it is too expensive to manually evaluate a large number of pages. Instead, we propose techniques to semi-automatically separate reputable, good pages from spam. We first select a small set of seed pages to be evaluated by an expert. Once we manually identify the reputable seed pages, we use the link structure of the web to discover other pages that are likely to be good. In this paper we discuss possible ways to implement the seed selection and the discovery of good pages. We present results of experiments run on the World Wide Web indexed by AltaVista and evaluate the performance of our techniques. Our results show that we can effectively filter out spam from a significant fraction of the web, based on a good seed set of less than 200 sites.},

LDA is a three-level hierarchical Bayesian model, in which each item of a collection is modeled as a finite mixture over an underlying set of topics. Each topic is, in turn, modeled as an infinite mixture over an underlying set of topic probabilities. In the context of text modeling, the topic probabilities provide an explicit representation of a document. We present efficient approximate inference techniques based on variational methods and an EM algorithm for empirical Bayes parameter estimation. We report results in document modeling, text classification, and collaborative filtering, comparing to a mixture of unigrams model and the probabilistic LSI model.},

The goal of the workshop was two fold. The first to provide a venue for the publication and presentation of negative results. The second was to provide a venue through which the authors of open source search engines could compare performance of indexing and searching on the same collections and on the same machines - encouraging the sharing of ideas and discoveries in a like-to-like environment. In total three papers were presented and seven systems participated.},

Later we did some tests on the Uniterm system of co‐ordinate indexing and, following a joint conference with the Classification Research Group, the idea developed of making a complete test of various indexing systems. A draft programme was prepared and was considered by many people in this country and the United States. An application was made to the National Science Foundation for a grant to cover the first stage of the investigation, and in July 1957 the Foundation advised Aslib that the grant had been approved.},

  abstract         = {The importance of a Web page is an inherently subjective matter, which depends on the readers interests, knowledge and attitudes. But there is still much that can be said objectively about the relative importance of Web pages. This paper describes PageRank, a mathod for rating Web pages objectively and mechanically, effectively measuring the human interest and attention devoted to them. We compare PageRank to an idealized random Web surfer. We show how to efficiently compute PageRank for large numbers of pages. And, we show how to apply PageRank to search and to user navigation.},

  abstract         = {In 1884, Edwin Abbott Abbott wrote a mathematical adventure set in a two-dimensional plane world, populated by a hierarchical society of regular geometrical figures-who think and speak and have all too human emotions. Since thenFlatlandhas fascinated generations of readers, becoming a perennial science-fiction favorite. By imagining the contact of beings from different dimensions, the author fully exploited the power of the analogy between the limitations of humans and those of his two-dimensional characters.A first-rate fictional guide to the concept of multiple dimensions of space, the book will also appeal to those who are interested in computer graphics. This field, which literally makes higher dimensions seeable, has aroused a new interest in visualization. We can now manipulate objects in four dimensions and observe their three-dimensional slices tumbling on the computer screen. But how do we interpret these images? In his introduction, Thomas Banchoff points out that there is no better way to begin exploring the problem of understanding higher-dimensional slicing phenomena than reading this classic novel of the Victorian era.},

We observe that disparate backgrounds, languages, tools and techniques are a major barrier to effective communication among people, organisations and/or software understanding (i.e. an “ontology”) in a given subject area, can improve such communication, which in turn, can give rise to greater reuse and sharing, inter-operability, and more reliable software. After motivating their need, we clarify just what ontologies are and what purpose they serve. We outline a methodology for developing and evaluating ontologies, first discussing informal techniques, concerning such issues as scoping, handling ambiguity, reaching agreement and producing definitions. We then consider the benefits and describe, a more formal approach. We re-visit the scoping phase, and discuss the role of formal languages and techniques in the specification, implementation and evalution of ontologies. Finally, we review the state of the art and practice in this emerging field, considering various case studies, software tools for ontology development, key research issues and future prospects.},

Em uma atmosfera altamente criativa, diferentes pessoas criam em conjunto um plano de projeto utilizando post-its. Trata-se de um método colaborativo pleno, no qual todos os stakeholders do projeto participam com proatividade, suprimindo a tão conhecida burocracia e o excessivo preenchimento de documentos desnecessários. Criado pelo professor José Finocchio Júnior, especialista em gerenciamento de projetos, este método é ideal para ser utilizado em ambientes que priorizam a criatividade e o dinamismo em seus negócios, permitindo uma melhor compreensão visual dos conceitos de um projeto, o engajamento da equipe e a rápida tomada de decisões. O Project Model Canvas concilia uma abordagem ágil e adaptativa com os fundamentos do Guia PMBOK ― 5a edição, apresentando-os de maneira amigável ao cérebro, por meio de técnicas da neurogestão.},

  abstract         = {The existence of sexual predators that enter into chat rooms or forums and try to convince children to provide some sexual favour is a socially worrying issue. Manually monitoring these interactions is a way to attack this problem. However, this manual approach simply cannot keep pace because of the high number of conversations and the huge number of chatrooms or forums where these conversations daily take place. We need tools that automatically process massive amounts of conversations and alert about possible offenses. The sexual predator identification challenge within PAN 2012 is a valuable way to promote research in this area. Our team faced this task as a Machine Learning problem and we designed several innovative sets of features that guide the construction of classifiers for identifying sexual predation. Our methods are driven by psycholinguistic, chat-based, and tf/idf features and yield to very effective classifiers.},

  abstract         = {There is a large body of evidence to suggest that child sex offenders engage in grooming to facilitate victimization. It has been speculated that this step-by-step grooming process is also used by offenders who access their underage victims online; however, little research has been done to examine whether there are unique aspects of computer-mediated communication that impact the traditional face-to-face grooming process. This study considered the similarities and differences in the grooming process in online environments by analyzing the language used by online offenders when communicating with their victims. The transcripts of 44 convicted online offenders were analyzed to assess a proposed theory of the online grooming process (O’Connell, 2003). Using a stage-based approach, computerized text analysis examined the types of language used in each stage of the offender–victim interaction. The transcripts also were content analyzed to examine the frequency of specific techniques known to be employed by both face-to-face and online offenders, such as flattery. Results reveal that while some evidence of the strategies used by offenders throughout the grooming process are present in online environments, the order and timing of these stages appear to be different. The types (and potential underlying pattern) of strategies used in online grooming support the development of a revised model for grooming in online environments.},

This research proposes the combination of sentiment analysis, new approach of sentence vectors and LSTM-RNN as a novel way for Sexual Predator Identification (SPI). LSTM-RNN language model is applied to generate sentence vectors which are the last hidden states in the language model. Sentence vectors are fed into another LSTM-RNN classifier, so as to capture suspicious conversations. Hidden state enables to generate vectors for sentences never seen before. Fasttext is used to filter the contents of conversations and generate a sentiment score so as to identify potential predators. The experiment achieves a record-breaking accuracy and precision of 100\% with recall of 81.10\%, exceeding the top-ranked result in the SPI competition.},

The presented system focuses on the problem of identifying sexual predators in a set of suspicious chatting. It is mainly based on the following hypotheses: (i) terms used in the process of child exploitation are categorically and psychologically different than terms used in general chatting; and (ii) predators usually apply the same course of conduct pattern when they are approaching a child. Based on these hypotheses, our participation at the PAN 2012 aimed to demonstrate that it is possible to train a classifier to learn those particular terms that turn a chat conversation into a case of online child exploitation; and, that it is also possible to learn the behavioral patters of predators during a chat conversation allowing us to accurately distinguish victims from predators.},

  abstract         = {Cyber-crime targeting children such as online pedophile activity are a major and a growing concern to society. A deep understanding of predatory chat conversations on the Internet has implications in designing effective solutions to automatically identify malicious conversations from regular conversations. We believe that a deeper understanding of the pedophile conversation can result in more sophisticated and robust surveillance systems than majority of the current systems relying only on shallow processing such as simple word-counting or key-word spotting.
In this paper, we study pedophile conversations from the perspective of online grooming theory and perform a series of linguistic-based empirical analysis on several pedophile chat conversations to gain useful insights and patterns. We manually annotated 75 pedophile chat conversations with six stages of online grooming and test several hypothesis on it. The results of our experiments reveal that relationship forming is the most dominant online grooming stage in contrast to the sexual stage. We use a widely used word-counting program (LIWC) to create psycho-linguistic profiles for each of the six online grooming stages to discover interesting textual patterns useful to improve our understanding of the online pedophile phenomenon. Furthermore, we present empirical results that throw light on various aspects of a pedophile conversation such as probability of state transitions from one stage to another, distribution of a pedophile chat conversation across various online grooming stages and correlations between pre-defined word categories and online grooming stages.},

In addition, our experiments show that using existing pre-trained word vectors are not suitable for this specific domain. Furthermore, since the learning algorithm runs in a massively parallel environment (i.e., general-purpose GPU), the approach can benefit a large number of computation units (neurons) compared to when CPU is used.

Specifically, using grounded theory methodology to analyze extant literature, a theory of luring communication (LCT) is proposed. The LCT begins by discussing how certain perpetrators gain access to particular types of children. Once in contact with a child, the perpetrator sets in motion the cycle of entrapment, which allows him to communicatively groom and entrap the child into accepting sexual advances. The theory then explores how certain communication responses by the perpetrator and the victim characterize the sustenance or disruption of an ongoing sexually abusive relationship.

Our recall is high, but it comes at a cost, as we return many false positives.

The peer-reviewed literature on internet sex offenders published between 2000 and 2011 was surveyed. Internet child sex offenders use a mixture of new and old technologies to abuse children. Offenders' awareness of internet-related risk appears to exist along a continuum. A number of psychological and demographic factors may influence offenders' perceptions of online security risk and their willingness to take security precautions. A surprisingly large number of apprehended offenders in the time period examined by this review did not seem to use any technologies to disguise their identities. A major research programme into internet offenders' use of identity protection technologies, and their use of technologies in general, is needed.},

In previous work we developed phrase-matching and rule-based approaches to classify and label lines of chat logs. In the current work we expand these techniques and use machine learning algorithms to classify posts. Our machine learning system leveraged the phrase-matching and rule-based systems to identify appropriate attributes for our supervised learning algorithms. Our machine learning experiments confirmed that the rules we developed are adequate to identify the coding rules. Neither decision trees nor instance-based learning algorithms were able to significantly improve upon the 68 percent accuracy we were able to achieve using the rule-based methods employed by a software program called ChatCoder 2, as described here.},

This paper proposes a study on predatory conversation detection using Natural Language Processing. We analyzed the different types of features of online grooming data considering various characteristics of online conversation, such as psycho-linguistic patterns. Our experiments with online communication showed an accuracy of 0.98 in automatically classifying the conversations into predatory conversations and non-predatory conversations. Best results are obtained by using linear SVM on 1-gram features when removing stop words as well as by using multinomial Naïve Bayes on 1-gram features when not removing stop words.},

Providers and law enforcement tend to use these huge logs anonymously for automatic online Sexual Predator Identification (SPI) which is a relatively new area of application. The task plays an important role in protecting children and juveniles against being exploited by online predators. Pattern recognition techniques facilitate automatic identification of harmful conversations in cyber space by law enforcements. These techniques usually require a large volume of high-quality training instances of both predatory and non-predatory documents. However, collecting non-predatory documents is not practical in real-world applications, since this category contains a large variety of documents with many topics including politics, sports, science, technology and etc. We utilized a new semi-supervised approach to mitigate this problem by adapting an anomaly detection technique called One-class Support Vector Machine which does not require non-predatory samples for training. We compared the performance of this approach against other state-of-the-art methods which use both positive and negative instances. We observed that although anomaly detection approach utilizes only one class label for training (which is a very desirable property in practice); its performance is comparable to that of binary SVM classification. In addition, this approach outperforms the classic two-class Naïve Bayes algorithm, which we used as our baseline, in terms of both classification accuracy and precision.},

Consideration will be given to how prominent theories of child sexual abuse often neglect sexual grooming. This will be followed by a detailed account of the existing knowledge within the literature. Three types of sexual grooming were thus identified: self-grooming, grooming the environment and significant others and grooming the child. Based on these findings, a new definition of sexual grooming is suggested. Furthermore, the findings correspond well with current models of the sexual offence process. A more comprehensive understanding of sexual grooming is required to facilitate a preventative approach to child protection.},

We describe our own experiences in constructing a significant ontology, emphasising the ontology capture phase. We first consider the very general issue of categorisation in modelling, and relate it to the process of ontology capture. We then describe the procedure that we used to identify the terms and produce definitions. We describe a successful way to handle ambiguous terms, which can be an enormous obstacle to reaching a shared understanding. Other important findings include: it may not be necessary to identify competency questions before building the ontology; the meta-ontology can be chosen after detailed text definitions are produced; defining terms which are 'cognitively basic' first can lead to less re-work.

Correlational and path analyses revealed that teacher involvement was central to children's experiences in the classroom and that teacher provision of both autonomy support and optimal structure predicted children's motivation across the school year. Reciprocal effects of student motivation on teacher behavior were also found. Students who showed higher initial behavioral engagement received subsequently more of all 3 teacher behaviors. These findings suggest that students who are behaviorally disengaged receive teacher responses that should further undermine their motivation. The importance of the student-teacher relationship, especially interpersonal involvement, in optimizing student motivation is highlighted.},
